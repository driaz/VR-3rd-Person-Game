# VR-3rd-Person-Game

Camera movement in VR is still a challenge for the platform as it can cause motion sickness, the purpose of this project was to test different camera controller solutions to alleviate this sickness. The 3rd person VR game was built primarily to test the new Unity input system, as well as movement in VR for 3rd person action adventure titles. 

Solution that was implemented was utilizing Unityâ€™s cinemachine module, damping both the Y and Z axis to slow camera movement along these axes.
